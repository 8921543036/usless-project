### Project Description
This tool helps you find the countdown to your favorite holidays quickly and visually. Simply type the name of a holiday in the search box, and the calendar for that holiday’s month will appear with the holiday date highlighted. You will also see how many days remain until that special day, along with a short description explaining the significance or meaning of the holiday. This way, you stay informed and excited about upcoming celebrations and important dates throughout the year

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Highlights the exact day on a calendar
